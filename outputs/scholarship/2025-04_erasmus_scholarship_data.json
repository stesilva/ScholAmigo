These seminars will take place in a hybrid format, making them accessible to students in all years of the Master’s program as well for all the students of the partners universities. NB: there will be 2 weeks per year of each cycle of annual seminars which will corresponds to 2 ECTS (4 ECTS in total) that students can use to integrate into their semester’s credits, in agreement with the teaching staff."

All along S1, they will be offered thesis topics by the consortium, including also topics offered by APs. They can of course propose their own topic to be validated by the pedagogical team. Once topics are chosen, they will work in S2 to deepen their thesis. Students will present their initial thesis topics during the summer school beginning of September. S3 will serve to go deeper in the definition of the thesis scope and lines of research. Through this activity, students will (i) experience a collaborative work over a long period of time (ii) have the opportunity to report their work in a professional environment (oral presentation, written report) and adapt their roadmap to meet the objectives. This activity will be monitored by academic supervisors (professors) provided by the full partners."

Thefirst semesteris thought as a basis for equalizing the level of the students, who come from different backgrounds and establishing robust knowledge of the theoretical foundations of inclusive education. Thesecond semesteris mainly devoted to challenges in inclusive education. Once the fundamental knowledge is mastered, the students can comfortably begin thethird semester, where they will choose their specialization between Justice, Interactions Sociales & Éducation, Interculturalité & Discriminations. The last semester is dedicated to the Master Thesis and internship, either in the academic or the non-academic sector."

The students' work is geared towards developing projects, in all cases involving different techniques and artistic practices: the study of sound, microphonics, recording, synthesis, processing, mixing and reproduction of sound, using both analogue and digital techniques.The Specialization in New Media Art promotes creative innovation in various artistic practices, in a transversal way.The program is structured around the conception, production, and presentation of cutting-edge projects that convey new forms of expression. The students will develop their projects according to their personal perspectives: whether experimental, artistic, or market-oriented. This challenge will be met and overcome with a thorough discussion between professor and student, as well as tutorial guidance by visiting artists. The research will be led through the development of projects, further expanded by theoretical and artistic reflection."

Krzysztof Kieślowski Film School has been cooperating with external stakeholders for years. The institutions and the company are included in the annual reports on the quality of education at the level of the fields of study and the entire faculty. The following should be mentioned: Polish Film Institute, Documentary and Feature Film Studio, Film Studio \"Kadr,\" Film Studio \"Tor,\" Film Studio \"Perspektywa,\" National Chamber of Audio-visual Producers, National Film Archive - Audio-visual Institute, local government cultural institutions from various regions of the country (e.g., from the Śląskie, Małopolskie, Wielkopolskie voivodships), theaters (in such cities as Katowice, Kraków, Wrocław), Internet companies related to the distribution of content on the Internet and Polish and foreign television broadcasters (e.g., Canal+, HBO, Kino Polska, TVP Kultura, TVP Katowice, and Netflix). Long-term cooperation with the stakeholders mentioned above results in their influence on changes in study programs. The group of people influencing changes in education programs also includes employees or co-workers of theatres, television broadcasters, film and television producers, technological studios, and large, medium, and small local companies. Without constant contact with distributors of new technologies, it becomes difficult to maintain the prestige of the courses offered at the Krzysztof Kieslowski Film School. One of the crucial areas of education is learning about innovative technologies necessary to implement images in film, television, and modern hybrid forms."

Often referred to as \"The Steel City,\" Sheffield played a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution, and remnants of its manufacturing past can still be seen today. However, the city has undergone significant regeneration in recent decades, with a focus on sustainability and culture. Located relatively close to Manchester and Birmingham, Sheffield offers a more affordable alternative to those larger cities. The city boasts a thriving arts and music scene, with numerous theatres, live music venues, and independent cinemas. Sheffield is also notable for its proximity to the Peak District National Park, providing ample opportunities for outdoor activities. With a down-to-earth atmosphere and a growing reputation for its independent spirit, Sheffield offers a unique urban experience."

It delivers experiences that both enrich as well asinspire new ways of understanding and communicatingwith the world around us. The Response_Able Futures Joint Masters appears at a time when the design sector is becoming more responsible and more responsive to the communities and existing structures that need designâs inclusive practice (e.g. including those excluded through cultural, socio-economic status, ethnicity, beliefsâ¦). Design is part practice (making and creating products and services) as well as a way to carry out research (through collaboration), and design is a lens through which to look at the world (design thinking).â¨"

It possesses frameworks and approaches that provide different insights into health_care systems that other types of research misses. Many organisations may have an inclusive vision, yet many struggle to be inclusive in terms of practice and outreach in both their preventative measures as well as care products. With an ageing global population in many Western countries, both formal and informal health_care practices are facing rapid transformation in terms of technical innovation and require designâs ability for innovation to benot only transformative but sustainable and people-focused.âIt is precisely these qualities that enables Design to drive disruption and innovation within the health_care sector. As a programme, the Response_Able Futures joint Masterâs seeks a balance between the designer as maker, critic and engaged citizen. In order for design to disrupt and innovate, graduates of the programme need experiences that equip them to deal with careâs complexity, requiring that design education shift from teaching skills in production towards facilitating reactive, immersive engagement that provides students with 21st century skills that are adaptable for a myriad of future contexts.Â"

Each semester has 30 ECTS and has been designed with a strong focus on a number of complementary core subjects that are organised along five focus areas: a context of care; contemporary design topics; design research methodology; design projects in health_care; and working around the individual positionality of students in regards to their current and future practice. Response_Able Futures is not a traditional course. With a diverse approach to educational delivery, but a shared vision on what it means to design for health_care, each semester builds on the previous, resulting in a programme that is a catalyst for graduates who are able to forge their own paths.Semester one focuses on inspiration and reflection. It serves to establish the students as a group, establishing individual reflective practice, build safe team dynamics where students are able to be critical and supportive, and inspire students through real-world orientated, exploratory led workshops and civic service experiences in which they learn by doing. In the second and third semester, students expand their network by integrating into local courses. The second semester focuses on skilling, applying and exploring design research methods across complementary disciplines within the context of care. The third semester focuses on applied experiences, providing students more freedom to define their own interests and refine their own ambition, including live projects, and hands-on engagements, through critical and speculative design and real-world placements."

The projects and accompanying thesis report will document the studentâs research process, methodology, experiences, analysis as well as showcase their individual position and values within a social care framework. Thesis work is composed of three parts: A project, a presentation and a report.ÂThe Response_Able Future students' Masters Final Project will include a well-documented, self-initiated personal design project in a student's specific area of ââinterest that will result in a prototype and related artefacts that can be exhibited to the public. The Masters Final Project will include a presentation to a selected panel of diverse jury members containing both lecturers and external members from both care and design. The presentation is an adaptation of the project report, which is a theoretical and critically grounded report that frames and reflects upon the Masters project. It will include a written project report/dissertation that positions the work in a broader context; highlights the identified need, defines their participation-based design process, situates itself academically and defines the workâs intended impact.âThese three parts constitute the studentâs Masters Final Project and Thesis. The projects will be defined by the students themselves, but can also be a specific need presented to the students from the wider care industry, that the student has selected as their topic. The project must be related to care as it is defined in the Response_Able Futures definition. As part of this Masters Final Project, students will present their work publicly and to industry through the Graduate Exhibition and online portfolio showcase."

For the final semester, students are supported in selecting a host university between LUCA, UA and SHU, with an even spread between the three countries.If the student's final project involves an organisation or company in a country outside of the three consortium countries, the organisation must become an official Associated Partner institution of Response_Able Futures.

Living expenses are estimated to be between 600-1000 Euro per month.

In this setup, students provide sufficient funds to support themselves for living expenses and each month the student receives the money back to pay monthly expenses. With this âBlocked Accountâ procedure, the LUCA School of Arts can provide a certificate of financial solvability that can also be used for other purposes such as e.g. visa applications.

Twice a year in Spring and Autumn, postgraduates (Master’s and doctoral), academic staff and associated professionals from participating universities and their non-academic partners meet at one of the university centres for a conference style ‘Common Session’. The CSP offers IMARC students an opportunity to engage freely with peers and academic staff in a range of structured and informal conference style settings. Though the seventeen university partners are centres of formal higher education, the Common Study Programme itself is a transnational and trans-institutional setting in which non-formal postgraduate learning takes place in the timetabled activity of the Common Session conference (see alsohttps://commonstudyprogramme.wordpress.com). A key educational element is the experience of short-term mobility, which is physical (geographical) as well as interdisciplinary and intercultural."

The students of each cohort spend the first semester in Belgium (LUCA School of Arts, Brussels), the second in Portugal (LU LusÃ³fona University, Lisbon), and the third in Ireland (IADT, Dublin). During these three semesters, the students all follow the same curriculum on the same location. There is also structural teaching mobility with BFM in Tallinn (Estonia), which means that BFM lecturers will teach one course unit - âFilm Data Analytics and Managementâ - throughout these three semesters in the three different locations. This will happen in hybrid format: BFM lecturers will partially teach online and partially teach on campus in Belgium, Portugal and Ireland."

        "text": "In 2020, the Cannes Film Festival agreed for the first time to project films that were not delivered on traditional 35 mm film prints, but in digital format (DCP). Two years later, from 2022, only DCP films were accepted. Analogue film, printed on 35 mm, which had been the industry standard for over a century, was fully replaced by a digital alternative. To the casual observer this might appear to be a relatively minor technological issue, whereas in fact it is indicative of profound changes at the heart of the industry and of film culture more generally. That, arguably, the world's most renowned film festival has replaced analogue (tangible, physical) film with the digital (virtual) format points to a technological revolution that is having a radical impact on what audio-visual media are and how they are transmitted to future generations. It exemplifies a seismic shift that currently sees most cinemas exclusively screening films in digital format, using digital projectors. This inhibits the accessibility of many millions of older films that, since the late 19th century, have been printed and preserved on film stock only. Digitisation of film prints alone cannot solve this problem, given that the process is time-consuming, expensive and â crucially - unsustainable, as experience shows that one must preserve the original film reels even after digitisation."

        "text": "Meanwhile, increasingly large audiences enjoy constant access to audio-visual materials via streaming services and content providers, viewable across a range of devices. While a small, highly specialised market aimed at cinephiles continues to exist for platforms such as DVD, the overall number of historical and arthouse releases by mainstream distributors has dramatically dropped, as viewers become more dependent on the constantly evolving catalogues of online streaming platforms. Streaming giants are creating a public perception that exhaustive audio-visual content is readily available, always and everywhere. While the business model of such services certainly offers major opportunities for the audio-visual industry, it also creates problems. The catalogues they offer appear extensive but in fact tend to be extremely limited in terms of geographical scope (mainly Anglophone-centric), while also focusing excessively on recent productions. Moreover, they are algorithmically driven platforms that can be seen as black boxes in terms of their curation of audio-visual material. Research shows that the film heritage that Europe has built up over a century is barely represented in the catalogues of mainstream services. The custodians of audio-visual heritage, therefore, need to rethink the ways in which they can utilise and disseminate their collections. In order to achieve these goals it will be necessary to thoroughly interrogate the current datafication of film cultures and heritage, the role that âplatformisationâ plays in this process, as well as the power and impact of algorithms and overall standards that are used to detect, analyse, store, curate, and disseminate audio-visual material."

Professionals who can not only archive and restore films, but also valorise and disseminate those collections. Professionals who understand the problems raised by archiving and preserving physical objects, ephemeral materials and âfound footageâ, as well as digital archives. Professionals who have the digital skills to work with databases and software that create new possibilities for curating and exhibiting films, as well as for doing research on films and film cultures, including undertaking quantitative analyses on film data. Professionals who ask critical questions about audio-visual heritage and are familiar with academic and public debates around archives and film heritage, and who understand the ways in which cultural and social factors, related to class, nationality and gender, have impacted these areas- and continue to do so. Professionals who can not only handle archival materials, but who are enthusiastically prepared to tackle the multiple institutional and practical challenges to bringing film archives into the future.FilmMemory intends to train such professionals."

The programme partly focuses on working with film stock archives, but also emphasises other contemporary challenges, including the role of digital media, tools, and associated skills, addressing emerging possibilities regarding the scope and dissemination of film heritage material. As a joint master's programme, taught in four countries across Europe, FilmMemory offers a thorough interrogation of the social, political, and industrial diversity of European film cultures. This includes the analysis of historical and contemporary modes of production, distribution and presentation, and the contextualization of filmic material within discourses of reception, critique, and scholarship. Students will explore the ways in which films and documents about film cultures are archived, preserved, restored, re-circulated, re-used and re-constructed. In this programme, âfilmâ is understood- in its broad, expanded sense- to include audio-visual creations that are usually viewed on single screens, whether in cinemas, on television sets, or on computers and mobile devices. It is additionally understood to refer to moving image recordings including, but not limited to, feature-length fiction films, animation, documentary, non-fiction, broadcast material, and series.Â"

The HEIs each have a different profile but complement each other in important ways. The HEIs educate filmmakers and practitioners within a pedagogical domain based on the interrelation between documentary, fiction, and animation. They also train film archivists, preservationists, and curators. In doing so, they offer a theoretical and critical exploration of film and the practice of filmmaking, as well as of researching and valorising film cultures, instilling in graduates a broad sense of the historical value and future potentials of screen media. FilmMemory will play a significant role in providing specialists for audio-visual archives, cinemas, festivals, film funds, journals, museums, digital image processing labs, distribution companies, production companies, publishing/press agencies, and government agencies, where this kind of expertise, and associated skill sets, are in increasingly high demand."

The PDF file can be no larger than 5 MB. This can be achieved with Adobe software, however, a simple online search will guide you to websites or tools that help you to convert files into PDF format and (if necessary) reducing the size of PDF files. The Portfolio should have a title page with the name of the applicant and a table of contents (explaining the structure of the portfolio and the parts it is composed of). It must be clear that (1) submitting a portfolio is not obligatory, (2) the Selection Committee may or may not take this portfolio into consideration. Crucial information should not be mentioned in this portfolio, but in the abovementioned CV and motivation letter."

The purpose of the written rectification\r\n              request procedure is to allow applicants to appeal against\r\n              the admission decision on the grounds of a possible error\r\n              in the decision-making, and thereby have an erroneous\r\n              decision corrected. An admission decision may only be\r\n              rectified if Aalto University has made an error in the\r\n              admission procedure and the error in question entitles the\r\n              applicant to have the admission decision rectified.

The students work in our open landscape, to develop their running assignments, work on their masters project ideas  and help and support each other. The planning will be concurrent with our national master, to ensure a strong connection between our national and international students. The students will be encouraged to share snapshots of their work and reflect on their own practice as a game designer, the methods they apply and the heuristics they use. The students will approach game design as a mindset, more so than game design as a theoretical field and are encouraged to discuss the different aspects of these projects such as the context, technology, design and implications."

It has 16,000 students in 11 undergraduate schools and 2,100 in 13 graduate schools. There are about 1,400 foreign students from all over the world.Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering (NAOE, OU) is one of the oldest departments in School of Engineering (founded in 1896) founded in 1800 and one of the leading universities which deal with naval architecture, ship technology or ocean engineering in Japan. Its undergraduated course is accredited by JABEE(Japan Acreditation Boad for Engineering Education), a member of Washington Accord in 2008. Over 100 years education, the graduates are distributed widely in the major shipbuilding companies or other relevant companies. For master course it established English Course in 2005 in graduate school where master and doctor continuous education is conducted with Japanese Government scholarship for foreign students. From 2007 all classes except Alliance (to be explained later) classes for master course are proviede in English.It has also established International Maritime Policy Special Programme (educational course) for master course in 2006. It encourages master students to be world leaders in maritime policy or management serving for IMO, Japanese Government or other relevant organizations. Therefore master course education is already quite international and it was quite attractive for foreign students who cannot understand Japanese. Kansai Maritime Alliance Education Programme is established in 2008 for master course. Kansai is the district name near by Osaka, which includes Kyoto, Nara, Kobe etc. In 2007 Osaka University(Graduate School of Engineering), Kobe University (Graduate School of Maritime Science) and Osaka Prefectural University (Graduate School of Engineering) have agreed to organize the above programme which is commonly available for these three universities. This is an attempt to share education between three universities, and it was realized, because classes are held at Nakanoshima Center of (downtown classroom/lecture room) of OU which is almost equal distance from three universities.For research activities NAOE, OU has totally about 20 staffs including 7 professors. Research area is widely spread from hydrodynamics, ship resistance and propulsion, seakeeping and ocean waves, ship stability and manoeuvrability, structure and strength, welding and fatigue necessary for ship/offshore structure design and underwater robotics and ocean environment. All NAOE Professors are internationally reputated and serve as IMO deligates, International Journal editors and other acaedmic societies/committees’ members."

These meetings help the students being acquainted with actors of the “world of work” and the “social dimension”. Graduated students present their master thesis (Annex A5) in front of this audience of professionals and students of the 1st year who can learn from their colleagues’ experience.

This research was conducted at Dr. Assumpció Bosch’s lab at the Institute of Neuroscience (INc), where the primary focus is on gene therapy for central nervous system diseases, as part of the TherCNS project at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.Through the rigorous mobility program, particularly at the University of Naples Federico II, I developed a keen interest in cancer drug delivery and multimodal bioimaging, specifically μCT-FMT, after participating in practical sessions at CEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate Franco Salvatore Scarl. Currently, I am a Lyon Excellence Candidate at the Cancer Research Center of Lyon (CRCL), University of Lyon, France.

The integration of ESS at the Polytechnic of Porto (IPP) was occured in 2006, however its historical roots are more distant, with a milestone in teaching at Hospital Training Centers in the areas of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Technologies. In 1980, the courses started to be taught at the Technical School of Health Services of Porto, still under the supervision of the Ministry of Health. Within the technological development observed in Health Services, it was necessary to create a superior training education in the areas of Diagnostic and Therapy, which led to the integration of these courses into the national educational system, at the level of Polytechnic Higher Education, passing the school to be named Higher School of Health Technology of Porto. The nomination was changed to the School of Health, in 2016.\r\n                            ESS is a Portuguese public recognized HEI that, according to the Portuguese regulations, may provide Undergraduate Courses and Master Degrees."

If students decide not to follow a track, they may choose the universities to study at freely, always based on availability of spots per university. In this, however, they need to followthe general mobility rules of the programme:all students need to study at least at two different universities (one of which at least from a European country), which have to be different from the country of residence of the student at the time of enrolment. Therefore, students who wish to study at Haifa, Arizona or Mumbai, our three non-European partners, will have to choose at least one other European partner to spend their EMLE year. Also, if a student listed, for example, the Netherlands as country of residence in his/her application, he/she can only spend one term in Rotterdam and has to choose two different partner universities for the other two terms (i.e., not possible to spend the first and second term in Rotterdam)."

It hopes to encourage students to go beyond multi-country/period statistical analyses and study the interface between law and economy as if both space and time, i.e., the historical context, mattered and appreciate the mutually constitute relationship between law, legal institutions, and economy.The course begins with an introduction to various economic perspectives on the relationship between law and development and then gradually complicates the narrative by bringing in multidisciplinary critiques, historical studies, and case studies on recent law and development interventions across the world.Selected topics: Lives of Poor, Vicious cycle of Poverty, Classical ideas such as Balanced and Unbalanced Growth, Development as choice among multiple equilibria: Nurkse equilibrium, Development through growth convergence and Two Sector Models: Arthur Lewis and Harris-Todaro Model of Migration. Child labor, Sexual harassment and Free Contract. Role of Property Rights in Economic Development: Basic model, optimal assignment of property rights, state capacity and property rights; Focal point approach to Law in Developing Countries: Coordination and Information. Political Economy, Law and Land Reform. Introduction to the inter-relationship between Law and Development; Analysis of Law, Finance and Economic Development; Competing hypotheses: Legal origins, Colonial history, Political economy, Institutional stability, or Transplant effect; Country and regional case studies; and Law and Society.Law & Economics of Development: Institutions (2.5 ECTS)This course is designed to expose the student to fundamental theoretical perspectives and empirical research that have developed over the years to study the emergence and functions of institutions, with special emphasis placed on law as an institution. Insights gained in the course will be helpful in understanding the role of institutions in development, and in analysing the process of economic change.The course is divided into four main sections, namely (i) why study institutions matter (ii) theoretical perspectives in institutional economics (iii) how institutions matter, and (iv) understanding institutional evolution. Topics covered under these sections include how social, political and legal institutions impact economic development, bounded rationality and institutions, the function of institutions in mitigating collective action problems,  rent seeking, interest groups and policy formulation, role of institutions in reduction of transaction costs, the role of rules and norms in coordinating and protecting institutions, and the role of behavioral interdependencies and path dependencies in institutional evolution. Case studies, cross-country empirical analyses and real world examples, particularly with respect to emerging economies, will be discussed along with each theoretical topic to help the student gain a practical understanding of how institutions function to facilitate/inhibit economic development.HamburgEuropean Union Law & Economics (2.5 ECTS)This course is devoted to an economic analysis of EU integration. We shall evaluate the case for economic integration in fields such as free movement of goods, free movement of workers, freedom of establishment, free movement of services and of capital. Understanding the legal framework and the lawmaking process is crucial for a complete picture of the EU. The course will also consider the economics of the Euro as a single currency, the design of the Eurozone, and the consequences of the financial crisis.Law & Economics of International Trade & Investment (2.5 ECTS)This course aims at enabling students to carry out the economic analysis of international trade and investment law autonomously and independently. This promises to be an intellectual challenge as the economic analysis of international law is still in its infancy.RomeExperimental Law and Economics (3 ECTS)Students will start with learning what experiments are and how they can be used both to advance our understanding of the world and to design better public policies, regulations and laws. We will then quickly overview the foundations of experimental methodology both in the lab and in the field. Students will thus be introduced to behavioural studies of human cognition and social interactions. Experiments have been key to the emergence of the field of behavioural law and economics and experiments are key to test the policies that exploit behavioural biases and social preferences (nudges).Selected topics: Cognitive Biases: loss aversion, ambiguity aversion, endowment effect, status quo bias etc. Social preferences and social norms. Preferences for conformity and expressive function of law. Randomization and causal inference. Treatment manipulation. Experimental design. Experimental software (z-tree) and paper & pencil techniques. Property law: the endowment effect, taking aversion and the hawk & Dove game. Contract law: specific performance and loss aversion. Criminal law: distributional and fairness concerns, adjudicative errors. Consumer choice. Behavioural Regulation, Nudging: persistence, acceptance and crowding out effects.Better Regulation (2 ECTS)Students will approach all stages of the regulatory process, from rulemaking to institutional framework and enforcement, and they will acquire tools to improve the flow and the stock of regulation used at national, European and international level. Students will also familiarize with a large body of evidence from cognitive sciences that is relevant to regulation and will discover how it is being currently used in the regulatory process. Another learning goal concerns the analysis of the impact of cognitive sciences on the regulatory toolkit.Selected topics: Economic regulation over the course of the twentieth century; What does good regulation mean, and what are its core elements?; Regulation and competition; Cognitive-based approach to regulation; New regulatory tools: nudging and cognitive empowerment; Tools for better regulation in the regulatory life-cycle: Impact Assessment; Competition Impact Assessment; Assessing regulatory burdens; Plain language drafting; Regulatory Enforcement.WarsawTax Law and Economics (2.5 ECTS)The course is devoted to delivering the knowledge on tax Law analysis with emphasis on International Taxation through the prism of Law and Economics. Starting with the possible applications of Law and Economics framework to the specific goals of taxation, showing the interconnection between law, public economics and corporate finance within the international tax law and economics topics. Continuing, the course provides the state of the art behavioral public finance overview of the problems of neoclassical approach to optimal taxation, by presenting the behavioral modeling approach to the commodity and income taxation. Following lecture is devoted the role of corrective taxation in a tax system and it’s impact on efficiency and regulation of negative externalities. After establishing the theoretical framework of tax law and economics, the course will introduce students to the general characteristics of international taxation as well as specific topics of international double taxation, transfer pricing and international tax compliance in detail.International Financial Markets and Regulators (2.5 ECTS)The aim of the course is to present the mosaic system of domestic and international supervision over the financial market from the EU perspective and outside of the European Union. The European Union has been active within the financial sector, in particular after the financial crises of 2009. Students will learn about institutions involved in the European supervision, e.g. European Central Bank as well as they will be taught about various regulations over financial market incluing outside oft he European Union.Selected topics:Microprudential v. macroprudential supervision; Three pillars of European Banking Union: Single Supervisory Mechanism, Single Resolution Mechanism, European Deposit Insurance Scheme; Capital Market Union; European Supervisory Institutions: European Banking Authority, European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority,  European Securities and Markets Authority.Special topics:Capital Requirements Directive 4 (CRD); Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR); Market Abuse Regulation (MAR); Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRDD); Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2 (MIFID 2); Payment System Directive 2 (PSD 2)."

        "text": "WarsawInternational Corporate Governance (2.5 ECTS)The aim of the course is to present the interdisciplinary concept of corporate governance by analyzing institutions and mechanisms of corporation supervision as well as institutions and mechanisms ensuring management accountability. In different economic systems, different mechanisms and institutions of management supervision have emerged. Hence, the course takes the systemic view of the governance structures found around the world. A systems view tries to discover the ”internal logic” of a set of corporate governance mechanisms and institutions – how well do the components fit together? After the course students are capable of blocks building of corporate governance system as well as know the corporate governance mechanisms and their appropriateness of an entire system.Selected topics: roots and perspectives of corporate governance, market governance, managerial incentives and corporate governance, ownership around the globe, debt governance, internal corporate governance (composition, structure and tasks of board of directors), board leadership, whether and how gender diversity matters for corporate governance, the rise of compliance, internal audit and risk functions, and corporate governance and economic development.International Financial Markets and Regulators (2.5 ECTS)The aim of the course is to present the mosaic system of domestic and international supervision over the financial market from the EU perspective and outside of the European Union. The European Union has been active within the financial sector, in particular after the financial crises of 2009. Students will learn about institutions involved in the European supervision, e.g. European Central Bank as well as they will be taught about various regulations over financial market incluing outside oft he European Union.Selected topics:Microprudential v. macroprudential supervision; Three pillars of European Banking Union: Single Supervisory Mechanism, Single Resolution Mechanism, European Deposit Insurance Scheme; Capital Market Union; European Supervisory Institutions: European Banking Authority, European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority,  European Securities and Markets Authority.Special topics:Capital Requirements Directive 4 (CRD); Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR); Market Abuse Regulation (MAR); Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRDD); Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2 (MIFID 2); Payment System Directive 2 (PSD 2).RomeExperimental Law and Economics (3 ECTS)Students will start with learning what experiments are and how they can be used both to advance our understanding of the world and to design better public policies, regulations and laws. We will then quickly overview the foundations of experimental methodology both in the lab and in the field. Students will thus be introduced to behavioural studies of human cognition and social interactions. Experiments have been key to the emergence of the field of behavioural law and economics and experiments are key to test the policies that exploit behavioural biases and social preferences (nudges).Selected topics: Cognitive Biases: loss aversion, ambiguity aversion, endowment effect, status quo bias etc. Social preferences and social norms. Preferences for conformity and expressive function of law. Randomization and causal inference. Treatment manipulation. Experimental design. Experimental software (z-tree) and paper & pencil techniques. Property law: the endowment effect, taking aversion and the hawk & Dove game. Contract law: specific performance and loss aversion. Criminal law: distributional and fairness concerns, adjudicative errors. Consumer choice. Behavioural Regulation, Nudging: persistence, acceptance and crowding out effects.Better Regulation (2 ECTS)Students will approach all stages of the regulatory process, from rulemaking to institutional framework and enforcement, and they will acquire tools to improve the flow and the stock of regulation used at national, European and international level. Students will also familiarize with a large body of evidence from cognitive sciences that is relevant to regulation and will discover how it is being currently used in the regulatory process. Another learning goal concerns the analysis of the impact of cognitive sciences on the regulatory toolkit.Selected topics: Economic regulation over the course of the twentieth century; What does good regulation mean, and what are its core elements?; Regulation and competition; Cognitive-based approach to regulation; New regulatory tools: nudging and cognitive empowerment; Tools for better regulation in the regulatory life-cycle: Impact Assessment; Competition Impact Assessment; Assessing regulatory burdens; Plain language drafting; Regulatory Enforcement.Aix-en-ProvenceLegal Framework for the Digital Economy (2.5 ECTS)The course aims at providing a thorough and rigorous analysis of the legal issues that follow from the deep effects that the Internet and digital technologies have (i) on the structure of existing markets, (ii) on the creation of new markets, and (iii) on the strategies that economic agents (firms, consumers and regulators) deploy on these various markets.The tools of the theory of industrial organization are used to understand a wide array of online market phenomena, including multi-sided platforms, impacts of ‘big data’ (targeted advertising and pricing, recommendation systems, privacy), net neutrality and online business models. The course makes use of case studies to make parallels between theory and reality.At the end of the course, students should be able to (i) master an array of specific concepts from the theory of industrial organization, so as (ii) to understand how the Internet affects the working of markets, (iii) as well as the strategies implemented by firms, consumers and regulators on these markets, and (iv) to apply these theoretical concepts to inform public policy.Selected topics: Software Platforms, Mobile Telephony, Two-sided B2B platforms, Online-Offline Competition; Digital Piracy: Theory; Digital Piracy: Empirics; Privacy; Internet SecurityCompetition Law for New Business Models (2.5 ECTS)The course will first establish, via real life examples, that the production of goods and services is more than ever best characterized as a discovery process driven by an entrepreneurial spirit that constantly shifts the lines of the pre-existing markets and, as a matter of fact, invents new ways of developing profitable businesses (Google, Facebook, Smart phones, Block chains, etc).  Starting from this analysis, the course will explore the relevance of the traditional concept of competition law (e.g. monopoly’s dead weight losses, SSNIP test or essential facility doctrine for a platform business) and their recent evolution. The course will also re-examine the articulation between, on one hand, ex ante regulation and, on the other hand, ex post correction via competition law in this new market environment. Finally, the role of intellectual property rights and their connection with the dynamic efficiency of markets will be investigated.Selected topics: Static versus Dynamic efficiency; The regulation of Electronic Payment Systems; The economics of internet hardware; Price Discrimination in the Digital Economy; Mobile TelephonyArizonaJustice Law and Capitalism (2.5 ECTS)This course is divided in two parts.The first part will expand the study of law and economics analysis (both theoretical and empirical) to the study of ethics. This will include an introduction to normative ethics, the problem of deontological and ethical preferences, justice theories and L&E and the connection between L&E and political philosophy.The second part of the course will focus on the application of the law, economics, and ethics method to a specific subject matter. The focus of the course for this academic year will thus be on Law, Economics, and Ethics of Corporate Social Responsibility and ESG. This includes CSR, market failures and government failures, the supply and demand models of CSR-ESG, from ESG to divisive moral goods, the aggregation problem, the moral corporation versus freedom, equality, procedural values and doux commerce. Finally, the course will also feature distinguished speakers who will relate their experience – and practical insights – about the rise of ESG in the corporate world, including executives at major US corporations and top corporate lawyers. In particular, the EMLE students will be required to attend at least three of the COL Mundheim Speaker Series, in which COL Prof. Robert Mundheim, former Dean of the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, moderates informal conversations with national leaders in business and law, relating their experiences in and perspectives about corporate governance, markets, ethics, and career development (seethis pagefor more information).Regulation of Emerging Technologies (2.5 ECTS)This course focuses on the legal regulation of computer technology; the liminal effects of certain such technologies; and emerging issues in the fields of law and computer science. The theoretical background for the course will be Larry Lessig’s “four forces” (law, code, markets, and social norms) along with select computer science concepts such as the classic CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability), fundamentals of object-oriented programming, and the end-to-end design principles of the early Internet. Core themes of the class will include (i) the interplay between governance by law and the horizon of technical capabilities created by computer science, and (ii) the tradeoffs that exist between an efficiency vs. a right­based approach to computer science, and how these tradeoffs can be normatively solved. Relatedly, the course will also expose students to some of the major ethical issues arising from computer science such as the ethics of coding and AI.After setting out the framework material, the course will move into a series of modules addressing current controversies in the field, including:Selected topics: The L&E of intellectual property protection, open access / open source regimes, and the reuse of materials created by others; Distributed platforms such as blockchain protocols (e.g., Ethereum) and P2P protocols (e.g., BitTorrent); The hacking ethos and ecosystem; Cyberwarfare and cybersecurity; FinTech; Machine learning models, “artificial intelligence”, and related social concerns (e.g., facial recognition, bias / fairness, transparency, creativity, accountability); AI and externalities; Encryption, surveillance, and anonymity; Resilient design; Internet of Things; Other autonomous systems such as drones / weapon systems, and human comparisons; The ethics of coding."

        "text": "MumbaiLaw & Economics of Development: Foundations (2.5 ECTS)The course introduces students to fundamental development problems, issues faced by developing nations, debates on the relationship between law and (economic) development and exposes them to the diversity of international experience regarding legal interventions to promote development. It hopes to encourage students to go beyond multi-country/period statistical analyses and study the interface between law and economy as if both space and time, i.e., the historical context, mattered and appreciate the mutually constitute relationship between law, legal institutions, and economy.The course begins with an introduction to various economic perspectives on the relationship between law and development and then gradually complicates the narrative by bringing in multidisciplinary critiques, historical studies, and case studies on recent law and development interventions across the world.Selected topics: Lives of Poor, Vicious cycle of Poverty, Classical ideas such as Balanced and Unbalanced Growth, Development as choice among multiple equilibria: Nurkse equilibrium, Development through growth convergence and Two Sector Models: Arthur Lewis and Harris-Todaro Model of Migration. Child labor, Sexual harassment and Free Contract. Role of Property Rights in Economic Development: Basic model, optimal assignment of property rights, state capacity and property rights; Focal point approach to Law in Developing Countries: Coordination and Information. Political Economy, Law and Land Reform. Introduction to the inter-relationship between Law and Development; Analysis of Law, Finance and Economic Development; Competing hypotheses: Legal origins, Colonial history, Political economy, Institutional stability, or Transplant effect; Country and regional case studies; and Law and Society.Law & Economics of Development: Institutions (2.5 ECTS)This course is designed to expose the student to fundamental theoretical perspectives and empirical research that have developed over the years to study the emergence and functions of institutions, with special emphasis placed on law as an institution. Insights gained in the course will be helpful in understanding the role of institutions in development, and in analysing the process of economic change.The course is divided into four main sections, namely (i) why study institutions matter (ii) theoretical perspectives in institutional economics (iii) how institutions matter, and (iv) understanding institutional evolution. Topics covered under these sections include how social, political and legal institutions impact economic development, bounded rationality and institutions, the function of institutions in mitigating collective action problems,  rent seeking, interest groups and policy formulation, role of institutions in reduction of transaction costs, the role of rules and norms in coordinating and protecting institutions, and the role of behavioral interdependencies and path dependencies in institutional evolution. Case studies, cross-country empirical analyses and real world examples, particularly with respect to emerging economies, will be discussed along with each theoretical topic to help the student gain a practical understanding of how institutions function to facilitate/inhibit economic development.Aix-en-ProvenceLegal Framework for the Digital Economy (2.5 ECTS)The course aims at providing a thorough and rigorous analysis of the legal issues that follow from the deep effects that the Internet and digital technologies have (i) on the structure of existing markets, (ii) on the creation of new markets, and (iii) on the strategies that economic agents (firms, consumers and regulators) deploy on these various markets.The tools of the theory of industrial organization are used to understand a wide array of online market phenomena, including multi-sided platforms, impacts of ‘big data’ (targeted advertising and pricing, recommendation systems, privacy), net neutrality and online business models. The course makes use of case studies to make parallels between theory and reality.At the end of the course, students should be able to (i) master an array of specific concepts from the theory of industrial organization, so as (ii) to understand how the Internet affects the working of markets, (iii) as well as the strategies implemented by firms, consumers and regulators on these markets, and (iv) to apply these theoretical concepts to inform public policy.Selected topics: Software Platforms, Mobile Telephony, Two-sided B2B platforms, Online-Offline Competition; Digital Piracy: Theory; Digital Piracy: Empirics; Privacy; Internet SecurityCompetition Law for New Business Models (2.5 ECTS)The course will first establish, via real life examples, that the production of goods and services is more than ever best characterized as a discovery process driven by an entrepreneurial spirit that constantly shifts the lines of the pre-existing markets and, as a matter of fact, invents new ways of developing profitable businesses (Google, Facebook, Smart phones, Block chains, etc).  Starting from this analysis, the course will explore the relevance of the traditional concept of competition law (e.g. monopoly’s dead weight losses, SSNIP test or essential facility doctrine for a platform business) and their recent evolution. The course will also re-examine the articulation between, on one hand, ex ante regulation and, on the other hand, ex post correction via competition law in this new market environment. Finally, the role of intellectual property rights and their connection with the dynamic efficiency of markets will be investigated.Selected topics: Static versus Dynamic efficiency; The regulation of Electronic Payment Systems; The economics of internet hardware; Price Discrimination in the Digital Economy; Mobile TelephonyBarcelonaAdvanced Topics in Law and Economics of Innovation (2.5 ECTS)The course provides a general overview of the problems arising from the interaction between technology and the law. The general economic analysis of contracts, torts and property will be applied to the challenges posed by smart contracts, algorithm contracts, self-driving contracts, the interaction between big data and competition law, the internet of things and the application of products liability and insurance to fully automated devices. Sharing and collaborative economy formulas will also be analyzed in the course.Advanced Course on Intellectual Property (2.5 ECTS)The course focuses on the specific issues that the internet poses to the traditional law and governance of intellectual property rights. From an economic perspective, the course deals with the impact of information technologies on intellectual property law regimes, collaborative creativity on the internet and other forms of shared innovations, digital exhaustion and challenges to the enforcement of intellectual property rights and to the application of traditional remedies. The course also deals with the legal and economic rationales behind specific remedies such as disgorgement of profits. The law and economics of technical protection measures and the impact of blockchain technology will also be analysed.ArizonaJustice Law and Capitalism (2.5 ECTS)This course is divided in two parts.The first part will expand the study of law and economics analysis (both theoretical and empirical) to the study of ethics. This will include an introduction to normative ethics, the problem of deontological and ethical preferences, justice theories and L&E and the connection between L&E and political philosophy.The second part of the course will focus on the application of the law, economics, and ethics method to a specific subject matter. The focus of the course for this academic year will thus be on Law, Economics, and Ethics of Corporate Social Responsibility and ESG. This includes CSR, market failures and government failures, the supply and demand models of CSR-ESG, from ESG to divisive moral goods, the aggregation problem, the moral corporation versus freedom, equality, procedural values and doux commerce. Finally, the course will also feature distinguished speakers who will relate their experience – and practical insights – about the rise of ESG in the corporate world, including executives at major US corporations and top corporate lawyers. In particular, the EMLE students will be required to attend at least three of the COL Mundheim Speaker Series, in which COL Prof. Robert Mundheim, former Dean of the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, moderates informal conversations with national leaders in business and law, relating their experiences in and perspectives about corporate governance, markets, ethics, and career development (seethis pagefor more information).Regulation of Emerging Technologies (2.5 ECTS)This course focuses on the legal regulation of computer technology; the liminal effects of certain such technologies; and emerging issues in the fields of law and computer science. The theoretical background for the course will be Larry Lessig’s “four forces” (law, code, markets, and social norms) along with select computer science concepts such as the classic CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability), fundamentals of object-oriented programming, and the end-to-end design principles of the early Internet.

The course makes use of case studies to make parallels between theory and reality.At the end of the course, students should be able to (i) master an array of specific concepts from the theory of industrial organization, so as (ii) to understand how the Internet affects the working of markets, (iii) as well as the strategies implemented by firms, consumers and regulators on these markets, and (iv) to apply these theoretical concepts to inform public policy.Selected topics: Software Platforms, Mobile Telephony, Two-sided B2B platforms, Online-Offline Competition; Digital Piracy: Theory; Digital Piracy: Empirics; Privacy; Internet SecurityCompetition Law for New Business Models (2.5 ECTS)The course will first establish, via real life examples, that the production of goods and services is more than ever best characterized as a discovery process driven by an entrepreneurial spirit that constantly shifts the lines of the pre-existing markets and, as a matter of fact, invents new ways of developing profitable businesses (Google, Facebook, Smart phones, Block chains, etc).  Starting from this analysis, the course will explore the relevance of the traditional concept of competition law (e.g. monopoly’s dead weight losses, SSNIP test or essential facility doctrine for a platform business) and their recent evolution. The course will also re-examine the articulation between, on one hand, ex ante regulation and, on the other hand, ex post correction via competition law in this new market environment. Finally, the role of intellectual property rights and their connection with the dynamic efficiency of markets will be investigated.Selected topics: Static versus Dynamic efficiency; The regulation of Electronic Payment Systems; The economics of internet hardware; Price Discrimination in the Digital Economy; Mobile TelephonyBarcelonaAdvanced Topics in Law and Economics of Innovation (2.5 ECTS)The course provides a general overview of the problems arising from the interaction between technology and the law. The general economic analysis of contracts, torts and property will be applied to the challenges posed by smart contracts, algorithm contracts, self-driving contracts, the interaction between big data and competition law, the internet of things and the application of products liability and insurance to fully automated devices. Sharing and collaborative economy formulas will also be analyzed in the course.Advanced Course on Intellectual Property (2.5 ECTS)The course focuses on the specific issues that the internet poses to the traditional law and governance of intellectual property rights. From an economic perspective, the course deals with the impact of information technologies on intellectual property law regimes, collaborative creativity on the internet and other forms of shared innovations, digital exhaustion and challenges to the enforcement of intellectual property rights and to the application of traditional remedies. The course also deals with the legal and economic rationales behind specific remedies such as disgorgement of profits. The law and economics of technical protection measures and the impact of blockchain technology will also be analysed.ArizonaJustice Law and Capitalism (2.5 ECTS)This course is divided in two parts.The first part will expand the study of law and economics analysis (both theoretical and empirical) to the study of ethics. This will include an introduction to normative ethics, the problem of deontological and ethical preferences, justice theories and L&E and the connection between L&E and political philosophy.The second part of the course will focus on the application of the law, economics, and ethics method to a specific subject matter. The focus of the course for this academic year will thus be on Law, Economics, and Ethics of Corporate Social Responsibility and ESG. This includes CSR, market failures and government failures, the supply and demand models of CSR-ESG, from ESG to divisive moral goods, the aggregation problem, the moral corporation versus freedom, equality, procedural values and doux commerce. Finally, the course will also feature distinguished speakers who will relate their experience – and practical insights – about the rise of ESG in the corporate world, including executives at major US corporations and top corporate lawyers.

Please note that at the different Universities only a limited number of spots are available. Therefore, students who do wish to follow a track will be allocated to their preferred universities with priority. The students who have indicated that they do not want to follow a track, will be allocated afterwards. This increases the chance that these students cannot be allocated to their most preferred allocations but maybe to their second choices for one or more terms."

Whereas private law assists individuals and groups who are willing to enter into agreements in a free market, public law seeks to correct the outcomes of a free market system by means of economic and social regulation. Economists themselves should be informed about the legal environment in which economic activities must be conducted, while lawyers should be aware of the economic effects of current legal rules and the expected outcome under a different legal regime. Law & Economics meshes together two of society’s fundamental social constructs into one subject, allowing a multi-faceted study of significant problems which exist in each subject."

The model of rational choice, which underlies much of modern economics, proved to be very useful for explaining (and predicting) how people act under various legal constraints. This positive analysis informs the normative branch of the discipline about possible outcomes. If effects of divergent legal rules and institutions are known, the normative analyst will be able to discern efficient rules from those that are inefficient and formulate reform proposals to increase the efficiency of the law. Also, Law & Economics has the ability to improve the quality of the legal system. In the last decades, an impressive literature has developed, showing the strength of both positive and normative economic analysis in various areas of law."

Richard Posner’s book ‘Economic Analysis of Law’ became one of the classics of the discipline. Recently, other methods have moved to the fore, including the Property Rights approach, the Austrian School and the Neo-Institutionalist approach. Finally, the Public Choice School, with Nobel Prize winner James Buchanan as an outstanding author, focuses more specifically on the political context of the law-making process."

From the very beginning, the programme received recognition and financial support of the ERASMUS Bureau of the European Community. Awards were granted every year for student mobility and the development of an international curriculum. In the first three years, the possibility to choose among different teaching centers only existed in the third term. From 1993 onwards, the network has offered a choice also in the first and second term and since 2002, students have been able to choose between a minimum of three different universities for each of the three terms. The number of partner universities has increased rapidly and the network now comprises seven teaching centers within the EU (Aix-en-Provence, Barcelona, Ghent, Hamburg, Rome, Rotterdam, and Warsaw) and three worldwide (Haifa, Mumbai and Arizona)."

Before that period, the EMLE was recognized as Erasmus Mundus Masters Course, both under the first edition of Erasmus Mundus (2004-2008) as underErasmus Mundus II(2009-2015). The programme has always been evaluated very positively by the reviewer-panels from independent academic reviewers. Like this, it was chosen by the selection committee in the first round of funding in 2004 as only few out of 128 applying programs. It is currently the only master’s programme that received funding over such a long period – from the beginning of the funding action until today."

Rotterdam, as the coordinating university in the EMLE Consortium, applied through the Dutch NVAO. For this procedure, extensive documentation and a site visit are mandatory. This site visit took place during the EMLE Mid Term Meeting in February 2024 in Rotterdam. On 16 May 2024, the positive decision by the NVAO for the Netherlands has been made. This accreditation is valid for 6 years, until May 2030. Currently, the EA-accreditation is being filed at also the other EMLE partner countries’ national accreditation agencies.

Both the selection for Erasmus Mundus and the national accreditation for several partner universities in the EMLE programme have been repeated since then several times. In 2013, EMLE was part of the ‘Joint programmes: Quality Assurance and Recognition of degrees awarded’ (JOQAR) pilot project by ECA, the European Consortium for Accreditation in Higher Education.

Then – and here is the good news – the EMLE will teach you how to make sense of this complexity, not just by studying more law or more economics, but rather by learning how to integrate the two perspectives.

This is just for your awareness and will not affect your application review.What happens if I can’t provide the necessary application documents?All application requirements have to be met before the deadline mid-January. Should you fail to provide the required documents, your application to the programme is incomplete and will not be reviewed.Do I have to provide original documents for the application?No. The application is completely online.

The document must have been issued within 12 months before the application deadline. Furthermore, the document needs to contain the date at which it was signed, your name and the place where you live.A passport cannot serve as a proof of residence!I do not have a background in Law or Economics, am I eligible to apply?Applicants with a other degrees than law and/or economics may also apply under the condition that they can show in their letter of motivation that they are clearly interested in studying the economic analysis of law and that they have a clear idea about the approach they will learn to apply within the EMLE programme. Their previous studies do not have to contain law and or economics, but the student has to be willing to study both subjects in order to have the necessary basics to follow the EMLE courses. If you’re in doubt whether your degree qualifies or you have any further questions regarding qualification, please contactapplication@emle.org.Where can I find the standard form for the recommendation letter?In the application form, you will find a section about recommendation letters. Here you should enter the (professional!) email addresses of your reviewers. They will automatically receive an email with the standard review form and an upload link.I want to submit more than two recommendation letters, is this possible?No, the maximum number of letters is two per applicant.I have not graduated yet, so I cannot upload a diploma to the application form. What should I do?If that is the case, you do not need to upload your diploma. Please upload a transcript of grades that shows the courses you have completed so far. Preferably (but not mandatory), this document also contains your expected date of graduation or a letter from your university stating this.The application deadline has passed for the next academic year but I would still like to join the program next year – what are the options?If the official application deadline has passed, there still might be the option for late applications to the program. To inquire, please contact the EMLE office atinfo@emle.org. Late applications can eventually be accepted if the applications pass the review procedure, if there are still spots at the different University partners and if the application can be submitted still in time for students to join the program from the start. It is possible, that desired tracks or term locations will not be available any longer. Also, late applicants may not be nominated for Erasmus+: Erasmus Mundus (EMJMD) scholarships.How can I apply for the Erasmus+ Scholarship?There is the possibility that the highest ranked students will be offered an Erasmus+: Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters (EMJM) scholarship by the European Commission. If you are admitted to the EMLE Program, you will automatically be considered in the allocation of the scholarships (you do not have to apply for it yourself). If you are interested in receiving this scholarship, you may indicate your interest in our application form. Once the application deadline closes, 15 January 2025, the separate application process for the Erasmus+ scholarship will start and interested applicants will be contacted.FAQ regarding admissionI cannot accept my place this year. Can the offer be deferred?In accordance with the official regulations stipulated by the European Commission, an offer or acceptance into the EMLE programme cannot be deferred to the following academic year. As a result, the applicant would have to re-submit his/her application during the following application cycle. Please note that such applicant, who has previously been accepted, is very welcome to refer to such previous offer in the course of the re-application.Why was my application denied?Due to the large number of applications, the staff cannot provide individualized feedback on your application. You can clickherefor the relevant rating criteria.I was accepted but I do not like my allocations. Can these be changed?The admission letter contains an allocation for all three terms. By paying the 600 Euro instalment for the tuition fee, an applicant officially accepts the allocations stated in the admission letter. Should an applicant desire to be reallocated to a more preferred location, she/he should contact the admissions staff. The conditions, deadlines and contact details for such a request are contained in the admission letter. Please note that reallocation requests can only be accommodated to the extent of available capacities at the respective locations.What is the waiting list?All students who fulfil the academic requirements of the EMLE but have not been ranked high enough to obtain one of the limited places in the programme are placed on a waiting list. If higher-ranked applicants decide not to accept the offered place, applicants on the reserve list will be contacted in order of their ranking. Typically such offers are made between the end of March and the end of April.I have not been accepted. Can I re-apply next year?Both applicants who cannot accept our offer this year (see above) and declined applicants are most welcome to re-apply for the next academic year. Please note that a transfer of this year´s results and/or information to the next year is not possible. The application form and the exact requirements normally change between years. For this reason any re-application has to be started fresh (i.e. the application form has to be filled in again).English was the language of communication during my studies, does this exempt me from a proof of English proficiency?No, you still need to provide a proof of English proficiency unless one of the exemptions applies to you.To what address should I send any documents?First of all, only send in hard copies of documents when requested to do so. Applicants do not have to send us any hard copies of their application.When using regular post and/or track&trace or courier services:University of HamburgInstitute of Law and EconomicsEMLE management officeAlsterterrasse 1, 2.

Can the offer be deferred?In accordance with the official regulations stipulated by the European Commission, an offer or acceptance into the EMLE programme cannot be deferred to the following academic year. As a result, the applicant would have to re-submit his/her application during the following application cycle. Please note that such applicant, who has previously been accepted, is very welcome to refer to such previous offer in the course of the re-application.Why was my application denied?Due to the large number of applications, the staff cannot provide individualized feedback on your application. You can clickherefor the relevant rating criteria.I was accepted but I do not like my allocations. Can these be changed?The admission letter contains an allocation for all three terms. By paying the 600 Euro instalment for the tuition fee, an applicant officially accepts the allocations stated in the admission letter. Should an applicant desire to be reallocated to a more preferred location, she/he should contact the admissions staff. The conditions, deadlines and contact details for such a request are contained in the admission letter. Please note that reallocation requests can only be accommodated to the extent of available capacities at the respective locations.What is the waiting list?All students who fulfil the academic requirements of the EMLE but have not been ranked high enough to obtain one of the limited places in the programme are placed on a waiting list. If higher-ranked applicants decide not to accept the offered place, applicants on the reserve list will be contacted in order of their ranking. Typically such offers are made between the end of March and the end of April.I have not been accepted. Can I re-apply next year?Both applicants who cannot accept our offer this year (see above) and declined applicants are most welcome to re-apply for the next academic year. Please note that a transfer of this year´s results and/or information to the next year is not possible. The application form and the exact requirements normally change between years. For this reason any re-application has to be started fresh (i.e. the application form has to be filled in again).English was the language of communication during my studies, does this exempt me from a proof of English proficiency?No, you still need to provide a proof of English proficiency unless one of the exemptions applies to you.To what address should I send any documents?First of all, only send in hard copies of documents when requested to do so. Applicants do not have to send us any hard copies of their application.When using regular post and/or track&trace or courier services:University of HamburgInstitute of Law and EconomicsEMLE management officeAlsterterrasse 1, 2.

For example, the lecture was given by Guido Calabresi from Yale Law School in 2021 (clickhereto see the recording) and by Katharina Pistor from Columbia Law School in 2022 (clickhereto see the recording). In the afternoon, it has become a tradition to invite the student who in the previous academic year wrote the best thesis to present his or her work at the symposium. The day ends with the Associate Partner Meeting during which our students can get in contact with representatives of the institutions that the EMLE cooperates with (clickherefor more information on our associate partners).

I have always been passionate about reducing waste, promoting recycling, and improving environmental sanitation in Nigeria. This concern stems from the lack of systems in Nigeria to effectively manage and recycle plastic waste. The country is overrun with plastic bottles that could be repurposed into clothes, bags, leather, or even new plastics, yet we continue to rely heavily on the importation of new materials. The IMATEC program presented the opportunity to learn advanced technologies in waste management, environmental sustainability, and materials engineering, which I believe are essential for tackling these pressing issues."

However, while having fun, don’t lose sight of your academic goals. It’s crucial to stay focused on your studies. Engaging in group discussions or study sessions can significantly enhance your understanding. While independent study works for some, learning with dedicated peers often leads to better results. Lastly, never hesitate to reach out to your professors or program coordinators when you need assistance. They are always willing to help, and their support has been invaluable to me. Best of luck with your journey!"

The reliance on copper mining further amplified my concerns about sustainability, as copper is a non-renewable resource, and Zambia’s mining practices did not seem sustainable. Before applying to IMATEC, I worked for a consultancy firm where I saw first-hand the negative effects of not utilizing resources efficiently, and the lack of implementation of circularity principles, such as reusing materials and leveraging naturally available resources—whether in energy generation, rural sanitation, or copper mining."

During the 11 years there he worked his way up to head of the strategic planning department, an area he has been involved in ever since. Among his job was also negotiating with potential foreign partners and drawing up long-term strategic plans, and in 1995 this work led to Ivan being one of the first three employees to found Unipetrol and later to participate in the creation of the joint stock company Česká rafinérská. At Unipetrol, he was involved in strategic planning, research, development and investment and became a member of the Board of Directors. Other work experience includes the position of General Manager of Koramo Kolín and Česká rafinérská a.s., later in 2012-2015 managing the preparation of a large refinery project abroad. Since 2016, he has been a director of the Association of Chemical Industry of the Czech Republic, an association that provides advocacy, education support, communication with the state and European administration, and support to member organizations in selected areas related to the chemical industry. They also promote chemistry to the public and bring together companies and research institutions and schools."

Through the \"Joint Master's Degree Programme in Service Design Strategies and Innovations\" (SDSI), the consortium aims to equip the next generation of leaders with the tools to navigate complex challenges within our evolving world.In a pivotal milestone reached in September 2022, AAL, on behalf of the SDSI consortium, signed a grant agreement with the European Education and Culture Executive Agency for Project No. 101082388, cementing the path forward for SDSI. Commencing with the academic year 2023/2024, SDSI has officially gained recognition as an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's programme.In a rapidly transforming Europe, where socio-economic paradigms are undergoing profound shifts, SDSI emerges as a beacon of change. This innovative joint-degree programme brings together the Art Academy of Latvia as the coordinator partner, the University of Lapland and the Estonian Academy of Arts as full partners, and the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga as an esteemed associate academic partner.ÂThe programme imparts a holistic education to create versatile service innovators capable of driving transformation across public and private entities through strategic design, management, and creative leadership. SDSI's interdisciplinary curriculum fosters cross-specialization in design, business, technology, and social sciences, facilitating the emergence of graduates poised to facilitate change and contribute to socially responsible global service organizations.Running from October 1, 2022, to November 30, 2028, the project No. 101082388 envisages four student intakes, commencing with the 2023/2024 academic year. Each intake will admit around 30 international students, with a minimum of 121 students experiencing the programme's enriching journey. Notably, the project allocates scholarships of 1400 EUR per month for the Erasmus Mundus, NDICI (Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument), or IPA (Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance) recipients among the top 81 students.SDSI promises an immersive international experience, with students embarking on at least two study periods of 30 ECTS in countries distinct from their residence - Latvia, Finland, and Estonia. The project boasts a grant amount of 4,899,600.00 EUR, of which 2,721,600.00 EUR are dedicated to student scholarships, exemplifying the consortium's commitment to fostering academic excellence.To augment the academic experience, SDSI consortium proudly welcomes two associate partners - the KuldÄ«ga District Municipality and the NGO âKuldÄ«ga Artistsâ Residence'' - who will enrich students' learning journey with invaluable extra-curricular and cultural experiences during their Latvian study tenure.For more information:https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/projects/search/details/101082388The European Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA), in the context of managing the Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters, collects and processes the personal data of some of the candidates. In particular, certain data of the scholarship holders and non-scholarship holders is shared with the Agency and treated according tothis privacy statement."

It is important to highlight that the allocation of these scholarships is contingent upon student geography.Under the Grant agreement with the European Education and Culture Executive Agency for Project No. 101082388, spanning the project's 2022-2028 timeline, the SDSI programme is authorized to grant scholarships as follows: 60 scholarships for students hailing from Erasmus+ Programme Countries, 3 scholarships for students originating from Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) region countries, and 18 scholarships for students from countries falling under the Neighbourhood, Development, and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) region.In accordance with the guidelines set forth by the Erasmus+ Programme Guide, this scholarship serves as a financial support mechanism, addressing students' travel, visa, installation, and subsistence expenses. Moreover, an all-encompassing health insurance coverage will be extended to all students, regardless of scholarship status.Important:candidates who have already benefited from an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master (EMJM) scholarship are not eligible to apply for an additional scholarship.Regrettably, as stipulated by the Grant agreement with the European Education and Culture Executive Agency for Project No. 101082388, the SDSI programme lacks dedicated funding for students with special needs. Nonetheless, the SDSI university partners remain steadfast in their commitment to offer comprehensive assistance to individuals requiring additional support, to the best of their capabilities."

Tallinn is the first point of entry to Estonia for most visitors, and if youâre the kind of person who likes to jump right in, then youâre in luck, as Tallinn city centre is never more than 15-minutes drive away regardless of if you happen to arrive by plane, train, coach or ferry. Tallinn Old Town is one of the best preserved Hanseatic town centres in the world. A stoneâs throw away youâll find the cityâs business centre with modern towers and luxurious hotels, trendy neighbourhoods and large shopping centres. Tallinnâs luring coastline dotted with promenades and sandy beaches is especially rewarding during the summer but offers scenic views of the iconic cityscape and breathtaking sunsets throughout the year."
